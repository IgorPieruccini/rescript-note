# Rescript Note

Firstval, that's my attempting of learning rescript and manipulating the dom directly, in other
words without using rescript-react.
The goal is to understand the basics of biding and sytanx throw building a simple note app.

## How to start

```bs
yarn serve
or
npm run serve
```

open your browser at: http://localhost:8080

it will start the webpack dev server and build the rescript files in watch mode.
so whever you change a rescript file, the js files are recompiled, so you will always
have he latest changes showing up in the browser.

## Clean up the js

```bs
yarn re:clean
or
npm rum re:clean
```

it will delete all the js file compiled.
